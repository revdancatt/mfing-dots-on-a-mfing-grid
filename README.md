## SPEED RUN

The tradition of doing a "speed run" on [fxhash](https://www.fxhash.xyz/) was started by [Alexis AndrÃ©](https://twitter.com/mactuitui) and his [fxhash SpeedRun: any% < 960 minutes](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/11995) project, described as "_A performance piece. From cloning the template to a decent piece in less than 960 minutes_"

## This piece
