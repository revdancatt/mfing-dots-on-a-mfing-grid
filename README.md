# M'Fing Dots on a M'Fing Grid

Is a fxhash speedrun any% < 720 minutes project. Started at 10:30am Fri 5th August 2022, and finished at 10:30pm Fri 5th August 2022.

You can see it running over here: https://revdancatt.github.io/mfing-dots-on-a-mfing-grid/

My fxhash profile is [here](https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/revdancatt), I will add a link to the project when it launches. You can find me on twitter [@revdancatt](https://twitter.com/revdancatt).

## SPEED RUN

The tradition of doing a "speed run" on [fxhash](https://www.fxhash.xyz/) was started by [Alexis AndrÃ©](https://twitter.com/mactuitui) and his "[fxhash SpeedRun: any% < 960 minutes](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/11995)" project, described as "_A performance piece. From cloning the template to a decent piece in less than 960 minutes_". 

Two more speed run collections have been created "[Consequence Broadcast](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/consequence-broadcast-speed-run)" and "[Beacon](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/beacon)" both by [Amy Goodchild](https://twitter.com/amygoodchild).

This is a `fxhash speedrun any% < 720` run.

The `any%` is from game speed running and means "to get to the end with any % finished", meaning you don't have to 100% complete the game, just get to the end credits. For a gen art project it means you can use libraries and copy bits and bobs from your previous code, without having to do everything from scratch.

`< 720` means that it's done in less than 720 minutes, in this case 12 hours.

## This piece

[Add more info here]

It is generally based on Damien Hirst spots.

One rule: No exact colour more than once, but I totally broke that rule, of course.
