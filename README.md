## About

This piece is generally based on Damien Hirst spots, with his simple rule of no exact colour more than once, but I totally broke that rule, of course.

The idea behind the project was to take one of the simplest things in generative art, randomly coloured dots on a grid.

Many projects use dots on a grid as the base foundation for building more complexity. However, just the dots themselves are often considered too simple to have as a project on their own.

Given the limited amount of time for a 12-hour speed run, I decided to see if I could take something as simple as dots and inject just a little bit of GenArt personality into it. The first step was to add some variation to the shape of the dots.
