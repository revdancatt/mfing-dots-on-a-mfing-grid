=======================================

Print size is square.

## Keypresses

'h' - toggle high resolution  
's' - save PNG file  

## Printing

The high resolution image outputs at 8,192 x 8,192 pixels.  

Print 27.3" x 27.3" at 300dpi
Print 69.4cm x 69.4cm  at 300dpi

Add `?forceWidth=xxxx` where xxxx is the pixels size you want. For example to print at 100cm high, the width would need to be 100cm. 100cm in inches is 39.37" at 300dpi = 11,811 pixels width. So using `?forceWidth=11811` and downloading will give you an PNG large enough to be safely printed at 1 meter height.
